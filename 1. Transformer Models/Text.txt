NLP 
NLP is a field of Linguistics (science of study of language) and it is ML focused and it tries to understand everything possible related to human language.
It does not only tries to undersrand the single word individually but also tries to undesatnd the full context of the language.
Egs - 1. Classifying Sentences (positive or negetive sentiments , email spam 0/1 , sentences correct in grammer or not)
2. Classifying each word (nown, adjective etc).
3. Text Generation - Completing a prompt with auto-generated text , filling the blanks (masked words)
4. Extracting an answer from a text 
5. Generating a new sentance from input text - Translationg into another language , summarizing.

Further dwelling one should have a basic information of API's.

The pipeline() API is a high level API which we can call in our code , and it does the required pre and post processing with the input , this API calling helps input to interact with the model on model hub.

An important point for the knowing purpose is - classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis") will download the cached model in the device , re running it won't download the model again.

The 3 step process involved is -
1. Text is pre-processed into a format model can understand.
2. The pre-processed inputs are passed into model via calling API 
3. The predictions of model are post-processed so we can make sense from the output.
