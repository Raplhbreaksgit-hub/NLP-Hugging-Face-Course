# NLP Course Journey with Hugging Face ðŸ¤—

Welcome to my self-learning repository for the Hugging Face NLP course! This repo is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn and apply various NLP techniques using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. I will be pushing code and notes regularly to track my progress and stay motivated. I'll write up the things I find helpful for myself from the course as well as the codes too , would try to be precise and concise on both jobs, the format in which I'll go would be I'll keep a text and a code section , in the text I'll try to summarize every useful aspect covered and there would be python script code in the code section of whatever I code that may not be that systematic and if needed anything specific it would be there in that respective section (not mentioned here).
